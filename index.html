			<h2 class="myH2">About Me</h2>
			
			<p class="myP">
				I'm Yang Xiaomei from Shenzhen, China. Since my father is in business, I have always wanted to study business. Therefore, I transferred to South Korea because my major in domestic university was not ideal. I'm taking online classes at school in China because of the epidemic. At the same time, I watched my father's work and felt that the development of technology has affected every aspect of people's lives. I want to learn MIS in this semester, and I want to be able to understand, use and effectively participate in the design or acquisition of information system, so I apply for this course. I hope to know the advantages, risks and trends of business technology management through this course.
				Talking about my hobbies , I love car racing very much and also I like travelling around different places.

			<h2 class="myH2">Product Review</h2>
            <h3 class="myH2">Amazon</h3>	<br>

			<p class="myP">
                Amazon is a world's largest E-commerce platform. 200 million unique monthly customers prefer making their purchases with Amazon over any other store.<br>
                <br><b>What I like about Amazon</b><br>
                Amazon's application is simplistic and easy to use. Searching is also very efficient.
                There are numerous products available to choose from and not to forget that they provide international products as well.
                The feature that I like the most is refund on cancelled orders and the customer can choose to return a product within 7 days of
                delivery. There are also options for faster delivery during urgency. In COVID days AMAZON played a very important role in people's lives
                as people were unable to move out of their homes and home delivery of products helped them follow COVID norms.
                <br><br><b>What I feel can be improved</b><br>
                There are lot of times the products don't meet the quality. There are a lot of differences in the prices that are shown to different customers.
                People also take advantage of price drop during site maintenance.
                Also sometimes there is a complex data feed and it becomes difficult to choose a great product by choosing the filters given .
                Technical glitches are also common in the mobile application.
